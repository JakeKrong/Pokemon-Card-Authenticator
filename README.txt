Pokémon Card Authenticator  
==========================  

Description:  
This program is designed to help users compare Pokémon trading cards by analyzing the images of CARD BACKS using a machine learning model. It provides a classification of whether a card appears "Real" or "Fake" based on the model’s prediction.  

Important Notice:  
This tool is intended for **personal comparison purposes only** and should **not** be considered a definitive method of determining a card’s authenticity. The results are based on automated image analysis and may not always be accurate. For official verification, consult professional authentication services.  

Usage Instructions:  
1. Run the program (Pokemon Card Authenticator.exe).  
2. Select a **single image** or a **folder** containing Pokémon card images.  
3. The program will process the images and display predictions along with confidence percentages.  

Image Requirements:  
- Images must be taken **strictly from a straight top-down angle**, capturing the BACK SIDE of the Pokémon card.  
- Avoid **shadows** or **uneven lighting**, as these can affect accuracy.  
- Refer to some images in the 'Example_Authenticate_Images' for reference.

Supported Image Formats:  
- PNG  
- JPG  
- JPEG  

Requirements:  
Ensure the required dependencies and model files (Data folder) are present in the same directory as the executable.
